**Significant Findings from NLP Analysis**
In this project, a Random Forest Classifier was used to perform text classification on a dataset. The process began with data preprocessing, including handling missing values, scaling features, and converting the data into a format suitable for analysis. The dataset, initially containing missing values, was cleaned using forward and backward filling methods and mode imputation. Feature scaling was applied to prepare the data for model training.
